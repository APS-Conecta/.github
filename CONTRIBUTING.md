# Contributing — APS-Conecta

Organisation-wide contribution contract. It applies to every `APS-Conecta` repository unless that
repository ships its own `CONTRIBUTING.md`, which takes precedence.

The repositories themselves are private. This file is public because GitHub only serves
organisation defaults from a public `.github` repository.

## Workflow (GitHub Flow)

1. Branch off the default branch, short-lived: `feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`.
2. Commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`,
   `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`, `refactor:`.
3. Open a PR. **One human approval before merge**, and treat that as binding whether or not any
   tooling stops you.
4. AI-assisted PRs are labelled `ai-assisted` and disclose the involvement in the description.
5. Run the repository's own gate before opening the PR. CI runs the same checks.

`CODEOWNERS` auto-requests reviewers. Prefer small, reviewable PRs.

## Issues

File new work with the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — a technical *Dev task/bug* and a
plain-language *Solicitud*. Use the plain-language form when you are describing a need rather than
a diagnosis; translating it into technical terms is the developer's job, not yours.

## Documentation rules

Documentation must let someone **rebuild** the system, not just read about it.

1. Numbered steps, one action each — the exact copyable command.
2. Every step states its expected output and what to do if it fails. A step you cannot verify is
   not a step.
3. Every command says where it runs — the host, or which container and as which user.
4. Never assert what you have not run. If it is untested, the document says so *there*, not in a
   preface.
5. One owner per fact. Others link; they do not repeat. A second copy desyncs the day it is written.
6. Prefer generated over hand-written.
7. Do not copy a gate's count into prose — say what the gate proves and let it print the number.

If a document mentions something retired, it must acknowledge that it is. Dated history — ADRs,
changelogs — is exempt; its date is the label.

## Decisions

Architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs under `docs/adr/`, following
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/). `Status:` is mandatory. Superseded ADRs stay in place and link
forward — a deleted ADR is a deleted reason.

A number is unique inside its own repository and means nothing outside one, so numbers are never
reused and never renumbered, and a series may carry permanent gaps. Cite an ADR from another
repository by naming that repository, with an absolute URL — never a relative path, which depends on
where someone happened to clone things. A decision affecting the whole organisation belongs in the
trunk repository rather than in the first product that needed it.

## Licensing

Everything `APS-Conecta` produces is **AGPL-3.0-or-later**. The dependencies it builds on are open source
and self-hosted, and because the Nextcloud apps link `@nextcloud/vue` the obligation is inherited
rather than chosen. Contributions are accepted on that basis: by contributing, you license your work
under the same terms.

Every repository carries one identical `LICENSE`, and the same identifier must appear in
`appinfo/info.xml`, `composer.json` and `package.json` wherever those exist. The brand marks — logo,
mono logo, lockup and favicon — are reserved under AGPL §7(e); the licence does not hand them over.

## Security

Do not open a public issue for a security problem. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
